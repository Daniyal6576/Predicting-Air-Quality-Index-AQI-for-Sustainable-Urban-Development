# Predicting-Air-Quality-Index-AQI-for-Sustainable-Urban-Development

Air quality prediction plays a vital role in monitoring and mitigating the adverse effects of pollution on human health and the environment. With the rapid urbanization and industrialization in various regions, the levels of air pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have risen significantly, posing a serious threat to public health. This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based predictive model for forecasting air quality, specifically PM2.5 levels, using meteorological data and pollution metrics. The proposed solution utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, with an emphasis on optimizing model performance through Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV). The primary objective is to enhance prediction accuracy by selecting the best model and hyperparameters through a comprehensive approach that combines data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. This project also have the application of these predictive models in real-time air quality monitoring systems to Predicted AQI value. 
# Introduction:
Air pollution is a growing global concern that not only degrades the environment but also contributes significantly to public health issues such as respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and premature deaths. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 7 million people die annually from air pollution-related diseases, with particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NO2) being the primary contributors. As cities around the world experience rapid urbanization and industrial growth, real-time monitoring and forecasting of air quality have become essential for managing pollution levels and minimizing health risks.
In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as powerful tools for addressing the challenges of air quality prediction. By analyzing large datasets of air quality and meteorological parameters, these models can identify complex patterns and make accurate predictions about future air quality. However, despite the advancements in ML algorithms, challenges remain in optimizing model performance and ensuring the accuracy of predictions across different regions with varying pollution levels.	
# Motivation
The increasing frequency of air pollution episodes, especially in densely populated urban areas, demands the development of predictive models that can offer timely and accurate forecasts. Traditional statistical methods for predicting air quality often struggle to capture the complex, non-linear relationships between environmental factors and pollution levels. Machine learning, particularly ensemble models such as Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, provides an advanced approach to overcoming these limitations. The motivation behind this research lies in leveraging these advanced techniques to improve the accuracy of air quality predictions, which can then be used to inform public health policies, government regulations, and individual decision-making processes.

# Problem Statement
The accuracy of AQI becomes a practical challenge since those datasets could be very unbalanced about the occurrence, under-representation of higher polluted levels in some of them; the modern techniques do not significantly provide good predictive power. The developed project helps tackle this imbalance through techniques, applying some data balancing methodologies and very advanced models.
# Targeted SDG
This project aligns with SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities by supporting air quality improvements, essential for fostering healthier urban environments.

# Proposed Solution
The goal of this project is to design a robust machine learning framework capable of accurately predicting PM2.5 concentrations based on historical pollution data and real-time meteorological factors. Additionally, this study emphasizes the application of Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV) to optimize the performance of machine learning models, ensuring the selection of the best-performing algorithms and hyperparameters for prediction accuracy.

 # Literature Review:
Air pollution is a pressing global challenge, with particulate matter (PM2.5) and other pollutants posing risks to public health and the environment. Recent studies emphasize the transformative role of machine learning (ML) in predicting air quality with precision. A central theme in these works is the importance of data preprocessing, including cleaning, interpolation for missing values, and normalization, to ensure robust model performance. Incorporating meteorological variables like temperature, humidity, and wind speed alongside pollutant data has proven crucial in improving prediction accuracy. A key focus in recent works is the incorporation of meteorological data alongside pollution measurements. Factors such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity play a pivotal role in the dispersion and concentration of pollutants. For instance, Li et al. used a hybrid model combining wavelet transformation with neural networks to improve the accuracy of air quality forecasts, demonstrating the importance of meteorological data in enhancing model performance [1]. This approach, which integrates environmental factors with pollutant data, helps generate more accurate short-term forecasts and better captures seasonal variations. Moreover, machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting methods (GBM), especially XGBoost, have proven to be effective in predicting air quality. These models handle non-linear relationships and variable interactions in large datasets effectively. In addition, the application of Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV) has been widely adopted to optimize hyperparameters, ensuring the best performance for these models. Grid Search CV is particularly useful in air quality prediction tasks, as it helps identify the best combination of parameters for machine learning models, leading to improvements in prediction accuracy and robustness [2]. Huang et al. applied ensemble models like RF and XGBoost to predict air quality in real-time, highlighting the significance of model selection and parameter tuning in achieving accurate forecasting. Their research emphasized that these models can capture complex patterns in pollutant data, improving both the timeliness and reliability of predictions, which are crucial for timely public health warnings and interventions [3]. Additionally, the inclusion of temporal data has allowed for more granular and region-specific predictions, making it possible to address pollution episodes in different geographical regions, such as the seasonal changes in air quality observed in China and Taiwan.
# Methodology:
The methodology for this air quality prediction project is divided into several key stages: data collection and preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search Cross-Validation (Grid Search CV), training and evaluation of machine learning models, and result analysis. The following detailed steps outline the approach used for building a predictive model for PM2.5 and other levels based on environmental data.
#	Data Collection
The dataset used in this project consists of several columns including:
•	state: The state where the data is collected
•	city: The city of the monitoring station
•	station: The monitoring station name or ID
•	date: The date of data collection
•	time: The time of data collection
•	PM2.5: The concentration of particulate matter (PM2.5) in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³)
•	PM10: The concentration of particulate matter (PM10) in micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m³)
•	NO2: Nitrogen dioxide concentration
•	NH3: Ammonia concentration
•	SO2: Sulfur dioxide concentration
•	CO: Carbon monoxide concentration
•	OZONE: Ozone concentration
•	AQI: Air Quality Index (AQI) representing the overall air quality
•	Predominant_Parameter: The parameter which predominantly affects air quality at the time of data collection
This data is sourced from various air quality monitoring stations across multiple cities.
# Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in ensuring that the dataset is clean and suitable for machine learning algorithms:
•	Handling Missing Values: If any missing data points are found in columns like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc., they are either imputed using appropriate methods (mean, median, etc.) or removed based on the severity of missing values.
•	Normalization/Standardization: Data is normalized to bring all the features to a common scale. This helps certain machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), etc., perform better.
•	Date and Time Processing: The date and time columns are converted into a format that allows machine learning models to process them effectively. We might extract day, month, year, and hour from the date-time column to create additional features for prediction.
•	Feature Engineering: Features like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc., are kept, but derived features such as day of the week, month, and time-based factors might also be added to enhance prediction accuracy.
# Feature Selection
Feature selection is used to remove irrelevant or highly correlated features, ensuring the  model does not overfit and remains efficient. Correlation matrices or techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) might be used to identify the most relevant features from the dataset.
# Model Selection
In this project, we utilize several machine learning models to predict air quality:
•	Support Vector Regression (SVR): SVR is used due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships in high-dimensional data.
•	Linear Regression: A simpler model that helps in establishing a baseline prediction.
•	Decision Tree Regressor: A non-linear model that splits data based on feature values.
•	Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method using multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
•	Gradient Boosting Regressor: A boosting algorithm that builds sequential trees to minimize prediction errors.
•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regressor: A model that predicts values based on the proximity of the data points in feature space.
•	Extra Trees Regressor: An ensemble method similar to random forests but with a different tree-building mechanism.
•	CatBoost Regressor: A gradient boosting model optimized for categorical data, suitable for handling high-cardinality features..
We also use GridSearchCV for model hyperparameter tuning to find the best combination of parameters that provide the best prediction performance.
# Model Training and Evaluation
Once the models are selected, they are trained using the training dataset. The training process involves fitting the models to the data while adjusting the hyperparameters to minimize error.
Model evaluation is done using:
•	Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing datasets (typically 75/25 split).
•	Cross-Validation: We use cross-validation techniques to validate the model performance and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
•	Metrics: The models' performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² Score. The model that performs best on these metrics is selected as the final model.
6.	Grid Search CV for Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid Search CV is used to find the optimal parameters for the selected machine learning models. This process involves:
•	Defining a parameter grid: For example, for a Random Forest model, the grid might include variations of the number of trees, the depth of the tree, and the minimum number of samples required to split a node.
•	Fitting the grid search model: Grid Search CV iterates through all combinations of hyperparameters and evaluates the model's performance using cross-validation.
•	Selecting the best parameters: The parameters that yield the best results are selected, and the final model is trained using these hyperparameters.
# User Prediction Workflow
•	Prediction Input: Once the model is ready, the user inputs the relevant environmental parameters. This data is passed to the trained model for prediction.
•	Prediction: The model processes the input values and predicts the AQI based on the learned patterns from the training phase. The prediction typically returns a continuous numeric value that represents the air quality index.
•	Visualization: The predicted AQI can be displayed alongside a graphical representation of the AQI scale (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.) for easier understanding.
